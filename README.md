# MP3.py-Widget
This is my MP3 demo project I created on the 5/10/2023 where It can run in the background,  it will read and then play any mp3 files i Have locally stored on my device. 
it uses functional GUI utilised by Python, tkinter, and Pygame libraries.

GUI, including the play, pause, next and back buttons as well as the labelling was made possible using tkinter 
for any music to be played we need Pygame to use its music player logic which provides all the functions for the mentioned created buttons above which both need to be conncected to event listeners giving full user input
